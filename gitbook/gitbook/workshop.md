description: Realtime Polling Application
---

# Introduction

Our applications are more connected than ever. But what happens when our users do not have access to the internet? Are we as application developers taking necessary steps to make sure our application can still be used in low or no network situation? What if the information our application provides are crucial? Imagine your flight updates from your airlines or fraud notifications from your bank. You would want your customer receives them no matter what.

In this workshop we will build a demo application that makes use of twilio, pubnub and serverless architecture to make a real time polling application that uses text messages as a means to collect answers from users.
