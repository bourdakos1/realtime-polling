# Next Steps

The app works. But there are a lot of things left to be done for this to be a production ready app.

1. There is no UI for Create Question yet. \(PR Welcome\)
2. Meaning full 404 Page. 
3. User Login so we don't put our secret in a JSON file in the front end. 
4. General betterment of the UI. 
5. Would be nice to get update of the vote count as a text.
6. There is no way to stop voting on a question.
