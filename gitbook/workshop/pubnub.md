# PubNub

1. Go to [https://dashboard.pubnub.com/signup](https://dashboard.pubnub.com/signup) to sign up for a PubNub acc. Their Free Tier should give us enough for our project and to tinker.
2. Once you have signed up and logged in. You should then create a new App.
3. In your app create a new keyset. Key set has a `pubkey`, a `subkey` and a `secretkey`. We will need this information in future steps.
